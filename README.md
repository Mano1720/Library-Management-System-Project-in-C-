# Library-Management-System-Project-in-C-
we are going to use C++ language to code  Library Management System


The Library Management System is a software which handles the entire data of library. It makes the work of librarian very easy instead of writing data in a notebook.
 
Features of Library Management System Project in C++:
> We have created separate logins for students and the librarian, in which the librarian is password protected.

> In this project, the librarian can add, update, delete and create books and can also assign the books to the students.

> The students can also view the list of the books available in the entire library database.

> The entire rights are given to the librarian to adding books, issuing books, and modify the book.

> This project uses file handling to store the data of books in a project.

> A Librarian can also be able to change the password.

> Reissuing and returning the books are the main features of this project.

> The student can also be able to see which student has already borrowed the book.


Modules of Library Management System:
> Add Book.

> Modify Book.

> Delete Book.

> Search Book.

> Issue BooK.

> Return Book.

The following menu will be visible to the Librarian:

1. View Booklist:
Same as students view booklist, librarians will also able to see the books available in the library database.

2. Search For a Book:
The Librarian can search book either by book name or by book id. Both the options are available in the project.

3. Modify/Add Book:
In this menu option Librarian can do three main operations i.e. Adding a Book, Deleting a Book and Modifying the existing Book.
As we are using the file handling methods in this project, Every time new file is generated to store the details of the books. i.e. Booksdata.txt.

4. Issue Book:
Due to this option The 70% of the work is been reduced. In this option Librarian can do the following operations:

          -> Issue a Book.
          
          -> View Issued Books.
          
          -> He can also search the students who issued the books.
          
          -> Librarian can also reissue the book to the same student.
          
          -> Return the Book.
          
       
          
          
          
Steps to Run the Project:

        -> Use dev C++ or Tubro C for typing the code.

        -> now Save the Project.

        -> Compile the project using compile option.

        -> There is no error in the source code, if found then correct it.

        -> Now run the project.


Summary:

     > In this way, weâ€™ve created and executed the Library Management System Project in C++.
